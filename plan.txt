Data:
Divide the data into 3 shifts for each day
For each of those shifts, calculate the MLE of the Poisson distribution => over long-time it averages out.
Sunday's last shift goes into Monday => remember to calculate based on this

Service time:
max: 10 tons 60 mins
min: 0 tons 5 mins
mode: 5 tons 32.5 mins

tons are distributed triangularly with mode 5.


Costs:
27*3*8 per shift * dock
average waiting time per shift * 27 

Total cost:
s_i_j : 0 if there are no workers needed in shift i at dock j
	1 if there are workers needed in shift i at dock j

if not all docks are busy:
s_i_j*27*3*8*docks_busy

if all the docks are busy, then the total cost :
s_i_j*27*3*8*docks_busy + average waiting time per shift * 27
